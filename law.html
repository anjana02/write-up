                Initially the participants are given with leaked terraform script which is used for automating
                configuration which is used by Law enforcement agencies infrastructure engineers
                <br>
                <img src="img/l1.png" alt="Log file details" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" > <br>

                Upon extracting the terraform we observed pieces of script pointing to one of the AWS service
                CODECOMMIT. CODECOMMIT is decommissioned for new aws users but its still active for old
                customers 
                <br>
                <img src="img/l2.png" alt="Log file details" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" > <br>

                On analysis of Code we observed aws CODECOMMIT credentials are base64 encoded and
                passed directly through terraform script. <br>
                The pieces of CODECOMMIT url is being passed separately on backup.tf
                <br>
                <img src="img/l3.png" alt="Log file details" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" > <br>

                Up on Decoding the base46 encoded data data the attacker got the an username and password
                separated by semicolon as said in the above code <br>
                <img src="img/l4.png" alt="Log file details" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" > <br>

                On initial google search the attacker identified the URL construction for AWS CODECOMMIT
                <img src="img/l5.png" alt="Log file details" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" > <br>

                With the base64 encoded data and the user credentials of AWS CODECOMMIT. The attacker
                tried cloning the repository and it was successful
                <img src="img/l6.png" alt="Log file details" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" > <br>

                ON analysing the LawEnforcement_Adversary City repo on AWS . The attacker observed some
                sensitive internal python script which is used for pushing logs to S3 buckets and involving
                cloudtrail. The bad practice of hardcoding AWS Secrets on python script makes the attack
                stretch to another conclusion
                <br>
                <img src="img/l7.png" alt="Log file details" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" > <br>

                <img src="img/l8.png" alt="Log file details" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" > <br>

                The attacker exfiltrated the AWS keys and configured them to elevate the access . the attacker
                hits the sts endpoint to understand if the user is still active.
                <br>
                <img src="img/l9.png" alt="Log file details" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" > <br>

                Up on enumerating different services the attacker was able to find a lateral movement from
                CODECOMMIT to SECRET MANAGER service.
                Hitting the list secrets api in ap-south-1 for secret manager gives as a stored secret of
                Lawenforcement agency
                <br>
                <img src="img/l10.png" alt="Log file details" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" > <br>

                The attacker finally hitting the get-secret-value endpoint and exfiltrated the secrets and other
                sensitive information.
