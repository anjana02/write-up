                The challenge starts with a webpage (booking.adversary.city). From here, users have the
                option to sign up, log in with GitHub, and view the source code of the challenge by clicking
                on the “Follow on GitHub” link in the footer of the homepage. From the Git commit log,
                players can get the initial
            <p><strong>Flag:</strong> <span class="flag">
                    AdversaryVillage{78a4c459e927913097973a105fa364db5d0a75d7}</span></p>

                After signing up or logging in, users only have regular user privileges. They can view listed
                apartments, and in the apartment details, there is a booking section (dummy) and a comment
                section.
                By reading the source code, users can understand that comment input is sanitised using
                Bleach (https://pypi.org/project/bleach/), but the app's Bleach configuration allows <img>
                tags and the onerror attribute for website usage. Additionally, users can notice that
                booking.adversary.city has an /api/github/redirect endpoint ( Can view from the home page
                itself). Combining these observations, users can trigger an XSS into the comment section to
                obtain the admin token from GitHub OAuth.

            <p>With the GitHub token, users can log in (see Figure 3) as an admin on booking.adversary.city.
                From the admin section, users can retrieve the user flag and access an interactive terminal.
                USER <strong>Flag: AdversaryVillage{57e6839090fedff92cf232349559dff631636246}</strong> </p> <br>

                <img src="img/w4.png" alt="Log file details" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" ><p>From the Admin Panel, By clicking the interactive terminal button opens a terminal via
                WebSocket, which is restricted to running Python binary only. The Python binary is
                configured with CAP_SETUID (which allows a process to change its user ID). Users can
                exploit this by running Python commands with root privileges, such as -c 'import os;
                os.setuid(0); os.system("whoami")'. This way, users can obtain the root flag.
