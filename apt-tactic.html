            <p><strong>Description:</strong>
                In the heart of Adversary City, a critical web application server has fallen into the hands of a
                notorious APT group. This cunning adversary leveraged a sophisticated web application attack to breach
                the server&#39;s defenses. Now, the investigation team is left with a single clue: a log file, brimming with
                cryptic traces of the attack. Your mission is to decipher the logs, uncover the attack vector, discover the
                removed code and track down the elusive APT group to capture the coveted flag. Will you rise to the
                challenge and outsmart the adversaries? The fate of Adversary City rests in your hands!
